[**REACT**](react.md)

## REACT ABC



**C**
* **Components**

**R**
* **React**


**S**
* **state** = Whilst props allow you to pass data down the component tree (and hence trigger an UI update), state is used to change the component, well, state from within. Changes to state also trigger an UI update.Only class-based components can define and use state . You can of course pass the state  down to functional components, but these then can't directly edit it.

**P**
* **probs** = allow you to pass data from a parent(wrapping) component to a child (embedded) component.
