**Hoisting**

* What is Hoisting?

* When Javascript compiles all of the code, all variable declarations using var are hoisted/lifted to the top of their                       functional/local scope (if declared inside a function) or to the top of their global scope (if declared outside of a function)             regardless of where the actual declaration has been made. This is what we mean by “hoisting”.
* You can declare a variable after it has been used;
* All declarations (var, let, const, function, function*, class) are "hoisted" in JavaScript.
  The difference between var, let and const declarations is its initialisation. instances of var are initialised with undefined while let   and const will throw a Reference error if you try to call one before it has been assigned a value.
