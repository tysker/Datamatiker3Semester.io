# One to One – Unidirectional 

Creating a unidirectional one to one relationship between two tables (in this exercise customer and address)  will create a foreign key on the table pointing to the associated table’s PK. This will ensure a link between the tables.

Unidirectional also means that the relationship is one-sided, and the direction of the relationship between the entities is A(FK) -> B
Where class A is the class holding an object of B.
