## 5 impotent Values

The values must secure that the individual is oriented towards the interests of the project (common culture)

1. **Communication**
  * Make sure of continuous and relevant communication
  * XP practices are not possible without communication
2. **Simplicity**
  * Better to build simple solutions that will be changed than to build complex solutions that never are used
3. **Feedback**
  * “Optimism is an occupational hazard of programming” vs. “Don’t ask me – ask the system” (concrete feedback)
4. **Courage**
  * Be ready to change the system – even dramatically and late
5. **Respect**
  * Everyone gives and feels the respect they deserve as a valued team member
  
  ___
  
  ## .XP Practices
  
  1. **The Planning Game**
  * The scope of the next release
  * Prioritized on the basis of business value and technical estimates
  * The costumer: Scope, prioritizing, sub deliveries
  * The developers: Estimates, technical consequences, a detailed plan (based on risk)
  
  2. **Small releases**
  * Put simple system into production quickly
  * Small with large value for business
  
  3. **Metaphor**
  * A shared understanding of the idea –substitutes architectures
  * Simple communication tool – naming concept of classes and methods
  
  4. **Simple Design**
  * Use the simplest possible design that gets the job done.
  * The requirements will change tomorrow, so only do what's needed to meet today's requirements
      1. Runs all tests
      2. Avoids redundant code
      3. Expresses important purposes
      4. Has as few classes and methods as possible
      
  5. **Test**
  * Continuously to reduce uncertainty
  * Programmers codeunittestsCustomers write acceptance/functional tests
  
  6. **Refactoring**
  * Constant restructuring of the system without changing the behavior to improve code – to remove duplication, improve communication,    simplify, add flexibility
  
 7. **Pair programming**
 * Programming is a pair activity (driver & navigator roles)
 
 8. **Collective ownership**
 * Not “no ownership”
 * Not “private” ownership
 * Anybody can change any code9.Continuous integration
 * Integrate and build the system many times a day, every time a task is completed
 * Requires the tests to run after integration
 
10. **40-hour week**
* Real productivity

11. **On-site customer**
* Real live user on the team to answer questions

12. **Coding standards**
* Eases communication through the code
* Ideally, you shouldn't be able to tell by looking at it who on the team has touched a specific piece of code.
